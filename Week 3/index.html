		<h1>More About Me</h1>
			<div id="paragraph"><p><strong>My dream is simple: I want to create great work in a job that I love.</strong> I studied Finance undergrad and upon graduation I explored many options within the Finance industry, none of which excited me. I have seen people work countless hours in jobs that made them miserable. I knew what I <em>didn’t</em> want. <br>
				<br>

			I was talking to my grandfather one day and he told me <strong>“If you don’t like what you are doing, then change it.”</strong> It is something so simple but had never crossed my mind. I had already spent years and money studying valuations and investments. After that advice, I started to look into other careers, ones that I was passionate about. After research and talking to people in the field, I discovered this career and and for the first time in awhile, I was excited about something. This is why I am here. My dream is to enjoy what I am doing. I hope to create work that I am proud of and passionate about. </p></div>
